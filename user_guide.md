been given access to. These can include OneCallAccess,
PositiveResponse, and Emergencies.

Through each service, users and service operators can perform
various functions and respond to the relevant inquiries. Please
see detailed explanations of each service and how to use them
below.

As a service operator, for all these services, you will need to
search for the company via the search bar at the top to see their
details related to each service. Users will not see the search bar
as their logins will show only the notifications related to their
company.

### 4.1 OneCallAccess

#### 4.1.1 Ticket Notification Delivery

The default page will show a list of ticket notifications delivered to a utility member. Here, a user can use the filters at
the top of the tool bar to filter by Station Code, Date Range, Individual Ticket Number or a Range of Tickets. Date
Range uses the Created Date data on tickets. This range defaults to a few days prior to the current date. However, you
filter the list of ticket data, you can sort the table according to ticket number in increasing or decreasing order by
clicking on the heading.

Once you find the one or more tickets you need to resend, simply tick the box to the leti of the ticket number and
then click the green ‘Send Notification’ buton at the top right of the screen.

Clicking the Send Notification buton brings up the following popup (see right):
If you have selected multiple tickets, all the ticket numbers will appear at the
botom of Delivery Status. Select what transmission type you would like these
notifications to be sent to or add a new transmission type by clicking Add Type as
required. Then click the envelope in the top right-hand corner of the screen to
send.

A small confirmation box will appear at the botom of the screen saying the
resend was successful and the Deliver Status will be updated to show date, time
and success of resend (see below):

This function can be used by both internal and external DPP
users pending their assigned user role. Service Operators have
the extra function of being able to see ticket notifications for
multiple companies. At the top of the screen, you must search
for the specific company in the search bar (see below)

This will display the notifications for the first Station Code listed in the company. You can see the notifications for
different station codes by clicking on the Station Code drop down menu and choosing the desired one. You can also
filter notifications by individual ticket numbers, a range of ticket numbers, and by dates within each station code.

#### 4.1.2 Summary Report Delivery

Summary reports provide daily overviews of how many OneCallAccess tickets have been received for each station
code. Each day’s summary report will be listed on the table as shown below.

Like with ticket notifications, it will list according to the first station code. It will list the date and the number of tickets
successfully received on that date. You can filter by station code, a specific date, or a date range. You can also choose
to include or exclude summary reports that have a value of 0 notifications for that date.

To send a report, select the desired date/s and click the Send Report buton. The status will change to show if it is
successful or not:

The report will be sent to the email address provided in the Member Contact details for that station:

The report will be sent to the email address provided in the Member Contact details for that station:

If you wish to change this destination, you will need to first edit the Station Member Contact email address via
Setings > OneCallAccess > Stations. See Viewing Stations for more information on how to edit.

A sample summary report is displayed below:

#### 4.1.3 Management Tools (Service Operators only)

Management Tools is available to service operators only. With Management Tools you can view stuck tickets, push
them through/cancel them, view OneCallAccess users and enable/disable them, or convert them to internal users.
Additionally, if you have the permissions, you can modify some OneCallAccess setings in the database.

It will open in a new browser tab and must be
logged into separately:

The initial page will be where you navigate to
various aspects of Management Tools:

You can navigate to:
- Enquiry Details – You can see all the details including background details of a particular ticket and can
reprocess the ticket from here
- LookupTables – You can create and amend high level groups of OneCall users and manage regional public
holidays for the OneCall calendar to operate by
- Notification Resends – Use this function to resend station code notifications either individually or in batches
- Search Customer – You can search for any customer, make them internal, deactivate accounts, validate
accounts, etc.

Below these butons is a table overview of failures so that you can see at a glance how many tickets and notifications
are stuck or errored. More information on this table is discussed below under “Dashboard Table”.

To logout of Management Tools, click the Logout buton in the very top right-hand
corner of the screen:

Note: Logging out of Management Tools does not log you out of
DamagePreventionPortal.

##### Enquiry Details

The default view that will appear on the right-hand side will be a blank Enquiry Details page where you can search for
the desired ticket:

To view the background details of any ticket, put the ticket number into the “(Request Number) Legacy Identifier”
field and click Search:

This will bring up all the background ticket details including a GIF, xml, gml, and txt files created by the enquiry and
various statuses for various aspects of the ticket. You can download the xml, gml and txt files from here if needed.

From here you can reprocess the ticket which means the old ticket will be cancelled and a new ticket automatically
created and submited with a new ticket number. To do this, click the Reprocess Enquiry buton:

##### Lookup Tables
This is where you can access and amend high-level groups of users and public holiday dates. Clicking on Lookup Tables
reveals a drop-down menu of two butons – Groups and Public Holidays:

##### Groups
Groups is where you can create, amend and disable various user types:

The groups of user types might be Admin, Internal OneCall Users and External OneCall Users. Each group type has a
unique ID shown in the first column. If the group is active or inactive, it will show in the second column. The third
column is the group name, while the fourth column shows if users in this group are internal or external users.
Timeout is a count in minutes of how long it takes for users’ sessions in that group to timeout atier periods of no
activity. In this case, all users regardless of group will have their OneCall sessions timeout atier 720 minutes of no
activity. They will need to login again if they wish to continue the session atier this time has passed.
The Limit columns are where you can setup a limit to the maximum number of tickets allowed within a certain time
frame. In this case, each user group can submit a maximum of 6 tickets within 2 minutes. If they try to submit more
than this in 2 minutes, the user will receive a message stating they have exceeded the limit, and they will just have to
wait a minute or two before they can submit more tickets. If Limit Block is activated for a group, it means the user’s
account will be disabled if this limit is exceeded and they will need to have a service operator re-enable their account
to submit more tickets.
reCAPTCHA is an alternative to limit the number of tickets being submit within a short amount of time. This can be
turned on for various groups as desired.
All updates are recorded according to the login name and the date and time of the update.
To update a group’s details, click the Edit buton in the last column. This will change that row to become editable:
When you have finished editing, click Save.
If you want to create a new group, click the Create buton and a new blank row will appear in the table to be
completed:
You can also search the groups according to any value in any column by the search bar under the Create buton:

##### Public Holidays
This is where you can input the various public holidays your entire region will have so that the OneCallAccess calendar
will incorporate these when choose the start date:

For example, if you have requested that all enquiries start dates have to be 2 business days from date of submital,
and there is a public holiday at one point during the week, the calendar will extend the start date by one or more days
as necessary so as not to include/count this public holiday as a business day.
Important Note: These holidays relate to entire regions, not states/provinces/territories, so local holidays should not be
entered here as it will affect all states/provinces/territories. For example, only public holidays consistent across
Alberta, British Columbia and Manitoba should be entered here, as the same calendar system is used across all three
provinces/territories.
Like in Groups, you can create a new Public Holiday entry by clicking the Create buton, search for public holidays to
see if they’re entered via the Search field and edit existing entries by the Edit buton in the last column of the table.
The table will show the first 10 entries. To see more entries, click the Next buton or the page number you wish to
view in the botom right-hand corner below the table.
You can also change how many entries are viewed at once by the drop-down menu in the top leti-hand corner above
the table.

##### Notification Resends
This section of Management Tools is used for resending OneCallAccess notifications:
- Resend Caller Notification: Enter the relevant ticket number in the Enquiry ID field to resend the caller
notification email to the contractor. Click Resend Caller Notification to complete.
- Resend Authority Notification By Sequence: To resend a station code notification to a utility member, enter
the relevant Notification Number in the Sequence No field. Click Resend Authority Notification to complete.
- Resend Authority Notifications for Authority: This function resends “goodnight” summary reports between
the dates entered in the fields below. Enter the Station Code in the Authority ID field and select which date(s)
the summary reports are required for. Click Resend Authority Notification to complete.

##### Search Customer
  
This is where you can view any customer and amend their details if needed, validate their account, make them an
internal user or remove their internal user status:
You can search by Username, User ID, Company, Email, Last Name or Group ID.
Note: You cannot create users within Management Tools.
Once you have found the user you wish to view, you can edit all fields except for Contractor ID and the Password
fields. Editing fields through Management Tools will not change the user’s ID, unlike in OneCallAccess.
To make a user an Internal User, tick the “Is Internal” box in their row and assign the relevant Group ID for the
internal users (if you are unsure of the correct Group ID number, you can go to Lookup Tables > Groups and see the ID
number assigned to the Internal user group). To change an internal user back to an external user, reverse these steps.
If you would like to make a user inactive, untick this box.
You can also validate a user’s account here by clicking on the drop-down menu in the Validated Email column and
selecting “Validated”.

Once you have finished editing the user, scroll to the end of the table and click Update in the very last column. This
will save the changes made.

##### Dashboard Table
This table shows the number of tickets and
notifications (caller confirmation sheets
and utility notifications) that are in a stuck
or error state. It splits it into Emergency
and Normal tickets/notifications.
The bar at the very top shows the last time
the table was updated. The table will not
automatically update while you are looking
at it, but if you open a new page within
Management Tools or refresh the page, the table will update. All tables accessed through these butons are ordered in
increasing ticket number order.

##### Enquiries
In the Enquiries row, it shows how many tickets are stuck or errored. In this case, 2 emergency tickets and 23 normal
tickets are stuck or errored.
Clicking the Enquiries buton will produce the screen below:
These lists show all the tickets that are either stuck (taking more than 15mins to process to the next stage), or errored
(failed). It is split up into 3 sections: Enquiries For Completion, Enquiries For Reprocessing, and Enquiries Without
Static Map. Each table will include the OneCall ticket number, the date and time the ticket was submited, the priority
(i.e. if it is an emergency or not), the status and an Action column to select which tickets you want to action. Tickets
will be automatically filtered into the relevant table. In this case, all the tickets are relevant only to Enquiries for
Completion.
A few minutes atier tickets have been actioned, they will disappear from the tables. If they get stuck or fail again, they
will reappear. If this happens continually with one ticket, this may need to be escalated to PelicanCorp Global Support.
The various statuses that will appear in these three tables are:
- JOB CREATED - Enquiry record created
- JOB OBJECT DESCRIPTION CREATED - Map object record created
- JOB TICKET AUDIT CREATED - Ticket audit record created
- JOB MAP GRIDS CREATED - Map grids created (Or skipped if not required)
- JOB AUTHORITIES INTERSECTED - AOI Intersection has run successfully
- DISABLE EXISTING AUTHORITY NOTIFICATIONS - Disable existing notification authority records (so you don't
get duplicates if you retry a job)
- JOB AUTHORITY NOTIFICATION CREATED - NOTIFICATION_AUTHORITY and DESTINATION records created
- DISABLE EXISTING CALLER NOTIFICATIONS - Disable existing notification caller records (so you don't get
duplicates if you retry a job)
- JOB PENDING - Only appears for tickets submitted by internal users while they edit the notified utility list
- JOB CALLER NOTIFICATION CREATED - NOTIFICATION_CALLER and DESTINATION records created
- JOB IMAGE PROCESSING - Job has been flagged for image creation (.gif)
- JOB PROCESSED - Image created
Note: if you have a lot of notifications in OPEN or READY, or the enquiry statuses are JOB CALLER NOTIFICATION
CREATED, then a good thing to do is to check if the windows services that those processes are running – to do this and
check the servers, you may need to escalate to Global Support.
In the Enquiries for Completion table, the various actions available are:
- Reprocess Job – this cancels the old job and automatically resubmits a new one with a new ticket number
- Complete Job – this pushes the job back one step to retry processing, which will hopefully be successful and
then automatically continue processing through the system
- Cancel Job – this cancels the job, but the job will still appear in the user’s history
- Deactivate Job – this is rarely used, it doesn’t cancel the job but removes it from all history and so invisible, it
is only stored in the background database.
  
To action a ticket/s, select the ticket/s you wish to process the same way, select the desired action and then click the
Action buton. You can also action all tickets but ticking the box next to the Action heading
Enquiries For Reprocessing are tickets that have become stuck very early on in the process and do not have an
effective status to be pushed back to in order to retry process (like you can do when you action a ticket as
“Complete”). These tickets need to be cancelled and resubmited, cancelled or deactivated. These are the only three
options available in the drop down for actioning tickets in this table.
Enquiries Without Static Map are tickets where the GIF map failed to be created. This could be due to an issue at the
point where the ticket details try talking with GoogleMaps to process the map. For these tickets, the options for
actioning these are:
All actions are as above, with the additional action of Insert Default Image. This will insert a basic image to enable to
the ticket to continue processing.

##### Notifications
The Notifications section shows how many contractor and utility member notifications have failed in total, breaking
them down into Caller (contractor) and Authority (member) numbers.
In this case, 140 emergency notifications have failed. Of these 1 was a caller confirmation sheet and 139 were utility
notifications. At the same time, 1555 normal notifications have failed – 15 of these were caller confirmation sheets,
while 1540 of them are utility notifications.
The various statuses that will appear in these two tables are:
- NOTIFICATION OPEN - Database record has been created and is waiting to be picked up to process. Note that
these will not process until the Enquiry is in JOB PROCESSED status.
- NOTIFICATION PROCESSING - Flagged for notification creation
- NOTIFICATION FAILED - Notification creation failed
- NOTIFICATION READY - Notification files have been created, waiting to be picked up to send
- NOTIFICATION SEND PROCESSING - flagged to be sent
- NOTIFICATION SEND FAILED - Notification send failed
- NOTIFICATION SENT - Notification has been sent
B2B Notification Status - No real difference other than the send method i.e. for utility notifications
- NOTIFICATION B2B READY - Notification files have been created, waiting to be picked up to send
- NOTIFICATION B2B RETRIEVED - Notification has been sent

##### Caller Notifications
This table shows the caller confirmation sheets that have failed to send or be received. You can either:

Complete Notification – pushes the notification back one step to retry and then
continue processing if successful
Deactivate Notification – choose this option if you wish to disable the notification from
being sent
Authority Notifications
This table shows the utility notifications that are stuck or failed. It includes extra information like the Sequence
Number and the Authority Name. It can only show approximately the oldest 100 notifications that need to be
actioned. A warning panel at the top will alert you that not all notifications are showing:
As you action notifications, others not shown will appear in the table at the botom.
Again, the actions available for these notifications are:
- Complete Notification – pushes the notification back one step to retry and then continue processing if
successful
- Deactivate Notification – choose this option if you wish to disable the notification from being sent
