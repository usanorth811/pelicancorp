## Ticket Examples
Example tickets are available in the following formats

### [PDF](/pelicancorp/ticket_examples/pdf.html)
The easiest format to use for members who plan on either printing or viewing their tickets on-screen, the PDF is a file format designed to present documents consistently across multiple devices and platforms.

### [GIF](/pelicancorp/ticket_examples/gif.html)
GIF is a standard image format. The GIF attachment will be an image of the job-site polygon as drawn or described by the excavator

### [GML](/pelicancorp/ticket_examples/gml.html)
The Geography Markup Language (GML) is the XML grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) . It allows for the transmission of the digsite polygon as a spatial object rather than as a picture.

### [XML](/pelicancorp/ticket_examples/xml.html)
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It provides a simple standard for transmitting ticket data to be consumed by most ticket-management systems.

### [Legacy Format](/pelicancorp/ticket_examples/legacy.html)
This is a replica of the format previously used in Newtin. Available in plain text, it remains as an option for those that would like to continue recieving their tickets in this truncated format.
