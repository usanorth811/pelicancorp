## Ticket Examples
Example tickets are available in the following formats

### PDF
The easiest format to use for members who plan on either printing or viewing their tickets on-screen, the PDF is a file format designed to present documents consistently across multiple devices and platforms.

### GIF
GIF is a standard image format. The GIF attachment will be an image of the job-site polygon as drawn or described by the excavator

### GML
The Geography Markup Language (GML) is the XML grammar defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) . It allows for the transmission of the digsite polygon as a spatial object rather than as a picture.

### XML
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It provides a simple standard for transmitting ticket data to be consumed by most ticket-management systems.
